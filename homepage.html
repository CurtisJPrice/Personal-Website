    <p>We here at Park Journeys are an information service that can relay information about local state and national parks. In this case, the parks are from the State of Oregon, where we have not only a few parks, but also various camping and RV camping sites across the state, from mountains to the coast. All this information is for the sake of tourists who wish to either visit state landmarks or are wishing to go on a nice camping trip. We hope you enjoy learning about the historical and mapping information we will provide for you.</p>

    <p color="#FFFF00">Here in Oregon state, we have plenty of State and National Parks that also have dedicated camping sites. some of these parks also have trails that lead to local historical landmarks, or to overpass views of Mother Nature in all her glory. If you want to know some of these historical landmarks, we have provided a few examples here that include what they are about, the date the landmark was founded and some information on the landmark's legacy</p>
