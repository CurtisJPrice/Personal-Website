    <h2>Boiler Bay State Scenic Viewpoint</h2>
    <img class="card-img" src="images/Boiler Beach.jpg" alt="Boiler" height="45%" width="45%">
    <div>
    <p>A miraculous and rugged, basalt-rimmed bay, Boiler Bay is a great place to watch wild surf action on the rocky spurs. This splendid panoramic viewpoint presents a good opportunity to see gray whales year round. Take your binoculars -- this is one of the best sites in Oregon to see ocean-going birds (like shearwaters, jaegers, albatrosses, grebes, pelicans, loons, oystercatchers and murrelets). In 1910, an explosion sank the J. Marhoffer, and you can see the ship's boiler at low-tide. Property acquired between 1926 and 1974 by purchase from various owners. Boiler Bay is named for the remains of a ship's boiler visible at low tide. They are the remnants of the freighter J. Marhoffer, which was wrecked off this point in 1910.</p>

        <img class="card-img" src="images/Bonnie Lure.jpg" alt="Bonnie" height="45%" width="45%">
    <div>
    <p>If you want to get off the beaten path, Bonnie Lure State Park along Eagle Creek provides a refreshing getaway. You may catch a rare glimpse of a pileated woodpecker or hook an elusive steelhead trout (otherwise known as a silver-sided freight train) on its way back to the hatchery. It could easily become your favorite day-trip destination. This park was purchased from the Nature Conservancy in 1976 with aid from the Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund.</p>

    <h2>Blue Mountain Forest State Scenic Corridor</h2>
        <img class="card-img" src="images/Blue Mountain.jpg" alt="Blue" height="45%" width="45%">
    <div>
    <p>Blue Mountain Forest State Scenic Corridor lies along the Old Oregon Trail Highway between Deadman's Pass and Spring Creek. The corridor protects one of the few examples of mature evergreen forests on I-84 between Ogden, Utah and The Dalles, Oregon. Composed of intermittent stands of old-growth ponderosa pine, western larch, Engelmann spruce, lodgepole pine and grand fir, this corridor contains undisturbed examples of the native plants and animals. White- tailed deer, mule deer, Rocky Mountain elk, cougar and other wildlife inhabit the corridor. Spring explodes in a multi-hued kaleidoscope of flowers. The fall frost ends the season in a final flurry of color. Take a break from the freeway and enjoy nature's beauty as you pass through this section of the Blue Mountains. The wayside was obtained from various owners 1927 â€“ 1937, with some adjustments in 1959 and 1983. The Blue Mountains are said to have been named about 1811 by explorer and fur trader David Thompson of the North West Company, who noted their bluish cast against the sky while descending towards the Columbia River.</p>
