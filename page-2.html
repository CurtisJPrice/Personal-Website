    <p>Bandon awaits the beachcomber, the explorer, the artist and the dreamer. Bandon State Natural Area comprises several spots to access the beach along Beach Loop Road in Bandon. Parking is ample at all locations. No beach camping from Bandon to Floras Lake. The land was acquired between 1954 and 1970 by purchase from various owners and a gift from Coos County. The city of Bandon was named for Bandon, Ireland, by George Bennett, who settled in the area in 1873.</p>

    <h2>Alderwood State Wayside</h2>
        <img class="card-img" src="images/Alderwood State Wayside - Oregon State Parks.jpg" alt="Alderwood" height="45%" width="45%">
    <div>
    <p>Large trees characterize this forested park along Hwy 36 between Junction City and Triangle Lake. There's a picnic area, restroom, and short trail along the Long Tom River. Bring a lunch and relax! Purchased from Lane County in 1931. Day-use picnic facilities were originally developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps around 1935. According to local lore, during the prohibition era (1920s), liquor was distilled clandestinely at a nearby location called Burp Holler. In 1961, the name was briefly considered for application to the wayside but the proposal was unsuccessful.</p>

    <h2>Beverly Beach State Park</h2>
        <img class="card-img" src="images/Beverly Beach State Park.jpg" alt="Beverly" height="45%" width="45%">
    <div>
    <p>Hidden in a forest between Cape Foulweather and Yaquina Head, Beverly Beach State Park’s creekside campground is one of the state’s largest. Some campsites and the park’s day-use area are just steps away from miles of ocean beach extending from Yaquina Head to Otter Rock. The park is central to excellent whale watching viewpoints, tidepools teeming with sea life, the Oregon Coast Aquarium, and shops and restaurants in Newport. A few steps from the ocean you'll find the forest-sheltered campground. Giant, wind-sculpted trees and nurse logs surround the campsites situated along pebbly Spencer Creek. A Welcome Center located near the registration booth sells firewood and a few souvenirs. A playground is located next to the program area. The day-use picnic area is a grassy spot protected from summer winds. The day-use area also contains a reservable group meeting yurt. Land along Spencer Creek was first acquired by the Highway Commission in 1942 - 1943 and subsequently transferred to State Parks. Additional properties were acquired from various owners by purchases, up to 1969.</p>
